# picoLume
An alternative to the xLume which was designed for the ESP8266 instead this is designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico (and MAYBE the ESP32 if I can be bothered)

As of now there are two different versions because I can't find a 5v power point on the phat that isnt standby where I want to install my pico, however I might have an idea what to do.
